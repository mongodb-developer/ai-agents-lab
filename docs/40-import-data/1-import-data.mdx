# üëê Import data into MongoDB

The documentation agent has two tools- a vector search tool to retrieve information from documentation to answer questions, and another tool to get the content from specific documentation pages for summarization.

Let's import the data required by these tools into two MongoDB collections. This is as simple as making a `POST` request to a serverless function that we have created for you.

Run the cells under the **Step 2: Import data into MongoDB** section in the notebook to import the data required by the agent's tools, into MongoDB collections.

To verify that the data has been imported into your MongoDB database, select the MongoDB leaf icon in the left toolbar.

Select **Add Connection**, then **Connect**. Finally, enter the connection string ```mongodb://admin:mongodb@mongodb:27017/``` in the top text input:

You can select the ```mongodb_genai_devday_agents / mongodb_docs``` collection from the left panel, and browse the documents you'll find there.
